Global MIDI channel:

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 50 0B nn F7 (MIDI channel-1, 0-15)

CV/Gate interface receive channel:

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 50 0C nn F7 (MIDI channel-1, 0-15)

Knob acceleration:

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00  41 04 nn F7 (0=slow, 1=medium, 2=fast)

Pad velocity curve:

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00  41 03 nn F7 (0=linear, 1=logarithmic, 2=exponential, 3=full – I prefer exponential).

# MANAGE LED

sysex:

F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 10 7n cc F7

where:
n is the pad number, 0 to F, corresponding to Pad1 to Pad16
cc is the color:
00 – black
01 – red
10 – blue
11 – magenta

#
# SET CC FOR PADS AND BUTTONS
#

for all the following commands the variable cc can be:

	Start		(0x58)
	Stop		(0x59)
	Cntrl/Seq	(0x5A)
	Ext. Sync	(0x5B)
	Recall		(0x5C)
	Store		(0x5D)
	Shift		(0x5E)
	Chan		(0x5F)

	Pads 1-16   (0x70-0x7F)


## MMC MODE (VV=7)

Invoked by

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 01 cc 07 F7.

Setting the parameter:

	MMC command: F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 03 cc vv F7

with vv:

	1=Stop
	2=Play
	3=Deferred Play
	4=FastForward
	5=Rewind
	6=Record Strobe
	7=Record Exit
	8=Record Ready
	9=Pause
	10=Eject
	11=Chase
	12=InList Reset

## CC SWITCH MODE (VV=8)

Invoked by

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 01 cc 08 F7

Setting the parameters:

Send

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00

and then…

	…02 cc vv F7 to set MIDI channel (vv: channel-1, 0-15)
	…03 cc vv F7 to set the CC (vv from 0-127)
	…04 cc vv F7 to set the Off value (vv from 0-127)
	…05 cc vv F7 to set the On value (vv from 0-127)
	…06 cc vv F7 to set the behaviour: 0=Toggle, 1=Gate
	Toggle means that one push switches the button on, the next switches it on, while Gate sends On as long as the button is pressed.

## SILENT CC SWITCH MODE (VV=1)

Works just like CC, but doesn’t light up the (red) pad LED while it is pressed, unlike the CC (vv=8) mode. Use this if you want to use the LED for feedback. (Found out by Ricard Wanderlöf.)

Invoked by

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 01 cc 01 F7

and then…

	…02 cc vv F7 to set MIDI channel (vv: channel-1, 0-15)
	…03 cc vv F7 to set the CC (vv from 0-127)
	…04 cc vv F7 to set the Off value (vv from 0-127)
	…05 cc vv F7 to set the On value (vv from 0-127)
	…06 cc vv F7 to set the behaviour: 0=Toggle, 1=Gate
	Toggle means that one push switches the button on, the next switches it on, while Gate sends On as long as the button is pressed.

## NOTE MODE (VV=9)

Invoked by

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 01 cc 09 F7.

Setting the parameters:

Send

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00

and then…

	…02 cc vv F7 to set MIDI channel (vv: channel-1, 0-15)
	…03 cc vv F7 to set the note (vv from 0-127, C0=18)
	…06 cc vv F7 to set the behaviour: 0=Toggle, 1=Gate

Toggle means that one push switches the button on, the next switches it on, while Gate sends On as long as the button is pressed.
Aftertouch (channel pressure) is transmitted in Gate mode only. In Toggle mode, velocity is transmitted with Note On and Note Off messages.

## PROGRAM CHANGE MODE (VV=0B)

Invoked by

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 01 cc 0B F7.

Setting the parameters:

Send

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00

and then…

	…02 cc vv F7 to set MIDI channel (vv: channel-1, 0-15)
	…03 cc vv F7 to set the actual Program Change value (0-127)
	…04 cc vv F7 to set the Bank LSB (0-127)
	…05 cc vv F7 to set the Bank MSB (0-127)


#
# SET CC FOR ENCODERS
#

The encoders 1-16 have controller numbers 0x20 to 0x2F, the large volume dial has controller number 0x30.
Encoders work either as MIDI CC controllers or as the more modern RPN/NRPN controllers.

## CC MODE (VV=1)

Invoked by

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 01 cc 01 F7

Setting the parameters:

Send

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00

and then…

	…02 cc vv F7 to set MIDI channel (vv: channel-1, 0-15)
	…03 cc vv F7 to set the CC number that is used.
	…04 cc vv F7 to set the lowest possible value (Absolute mode only)
	…05 cc vv F7 to set the highest possible value (Absolute mode only)
	…06 cc vv F7 to set the behaviour: 0=Absolute, 1-3=Relative mode 1-3.

## RPN/NRPN MODE (VV=4)

Invoked by

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00 01 cc 04 F7

Setting the parameters:

Send

	F0 00 20 6B 7F 42 02 00

and then…

	…02 cc vv F7 to set MIDI channel (vv: channel-1, 0-15)
	…03 cc vv F7 to set Coarse/Fine: 0x06=Coarse, 0x26=Fine (this actually determins whether the MSB or the LSB of the parameter is sent)
	…04 cc vv F7 to set the Bank LSB of the parameter to be sent
	…05 cc vv F7 to set the Bank MSB of the paramter to be sent
	…06 cc vv F7 to set the type: 0=NRPN, 1=RPN
